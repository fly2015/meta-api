Managing dependencies in a Maven project can be a complex task due to the potential for conflicts and the need to keep dependencies up-to-date. Here are some best practices:  
Use Dependency Management: If you have a multi-module project, use the <dependencyManagement> section in your parent POM to manage the versions of your dependencies. This helps to avoid version conflicts and makes it easier to update versions.  
Avoid Unnecessary Dependencies: Only add a dependency if it's necessary. Unnecessary dependencies can lead to conflicts and make your project harder to manage.  
Use Scope to Limit Dependency Usage: Maven provides several scopes (like compile, provided, runtime, test, system, and import) to limit the classpath visibility of a dependency. Use these scopes wisely to avoid classpath issues.  
Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date: Regularly update your dependencies to get the benefit of bug fixes, performance improvements, and new features. Tools like the Maven Versions Plugin can help with this.  
Analyze Dependencies: Use Maven's dependency analysis tools (mvn dependency:analyze) to identify unused dependencies and undeclared dependencies.  
Handle Transitive Dependencies: Be aware of transitive dependencies and manage them properly. You can exclude unnecessary transitive dependencies and fix the versions of important ones.  
Use Properties for Version Numbers: Define the versions of your dependencies as properties in your POM. This makes it easier to update versions and ensures consistency across your project.  
Avoid System Scope: The system scope requires you to manually manage the dependency's location, which can lead to build reproducibility issues. It's better to use a repository manager like Nexus or Artifactory.  
Use a Repository Manager: A repository manager acts as a dedicated server for hosting and retrieving artifacts, and can cache remote artifacts, provide a deployment destination for your builds, and much more.  
Beware of Version Ranges: While Maven supports version ranges for dependencies, they can lead to non-reproducible builds if a new version of the dependency is released. It's generally better to fix the versions of your dependencies.
